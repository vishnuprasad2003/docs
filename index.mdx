## How the Credit Facility Works

The Credit Facility workflow guides you through four main stages. Each stage builds upon the previous one, creating a streamlined path from initial request to receiving funds.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Term Sheet Creation" icon="file-contract">
    **You (the Borrower)** start by creating a term sheet that outlines your credit facility request—how much you need, the terms, and supporting documents. After signing electronically, you submit it for review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Master Commitment Setup" icon="handshake">
    Once your term sheet is approved, a **Master Commitment** is automatically created. The Facility Agent configures the lenders and rules, then lenders review and approve it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Funding Request" icon="money-bill-wave">
    With an active Master Commitment, you can now **request funds**. Submit your funding request with the amount you need, and the Facility Agent will review and approve it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Funding & Token Transfer" icon="coins">
    Approved requests generate **Funding Notices** automatically. Tokens are created and distributed, and lenders transfer funds directly to you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

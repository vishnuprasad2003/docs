## What is Loan Onboarding?

Loan onboarding is the process of importing loan data into the Intain Markets platform, standardizing it to a common format, and preparing it for verification and tokenization. This includes:

- **Uploading loan tapes** (Excel/CSV files)
- **Mapping fields** to standard formats
- **Processing and validating** loan data
- **Creating verification batches**
- **Verifying loan accuracy** (self-certification or VA verification)
- **Minting NFT certificates** on blockchain

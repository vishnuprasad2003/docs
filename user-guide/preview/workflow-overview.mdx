## Preview & Verification Flow ‚Äî Complete Workflow

This guide explains how the Preview and Verification Flow ensures accurate, verified loan data through collaborative review before investment opportunities are published.

<Info>
**Preview & Verification ensures data quality** before pools are accepted, priced, or published for investment through collaborative feedback and formal verification by Verification Agents.
</Info>

## Overview

The Preview and Verification Flow ensures that before any pool is accepted, priced, or published for investment, the underlying loan data is:
- Accurate and verified
- Reviewed by stakeholders (Underwriters, Investors, Rating Agencies)
- Certified by Verification Agents
- Feedback collected, reconciled, and approved

**This process maintains** the integrity, quality, and credibility of the asset data within the platform.

## Preview & Verification Flow Overview

The Preview & Verification workflow ensures that before any pool is accepted, priced, or published for investment, the underlying loan data is accurate, verified, and reviewed by all relevant stakeholders.

<Info>
**Purpose**: Preview & Verification provides a multi-phase collaborative process for reviewing, validating, and certifying loan pools before they enter securitization or sale workflows.

# Batch Management

Batches are collections of loans grouped together for efficient verification. This guide covers everything you need to know about creating, managing, and tracking batches through the verification process.

## What is a Batch?

A **Batch** is a group of loans that are verified together. Batches streamline the verification process by allowing you to:

- Organize loans logically (by date, asset class, pool, etc.)
- Submit multiple loans for verification at once
- Track verification status for groups of loans
- Generate certificates for multiple loans together

**Batch ID Format:**
```
[OrgCode][Date][Sequence]
Example: ABC241201001
```
- **OrgCode**: First 3 letters of issuer organization name
- **Date**: DDMMYY format (e.g., 241201 = December 1, 2024)
- **Sequence**: 3-digit sequence number (001, 002, etc.)

## Batch Status Lifecycle

Batches progress through different statuses as they move through verification:

    A[Created] --> B[Pending]
    B --> C{Verification Method}
    C -->|ZohoSign| D[Self-Certified]
    C -->|VA| E[VA Reviewing]
    D --> F[Verified]
    E --> G{Who Verifies?}
    G -->|Same Email| H[Self Certified]
    G -->|Different User| I[Certified]
    H --> J[Reviewed]
    I --> J
    F --> J
```

| Status | Description | What Happens Next |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Pending** | Batch created, awaiting verification | Choose verification method |
| **Verified** | Batch verified (self-certified) | Ready for NFT minting |
| **Reviewed** | Batch reviewed by VA | Ready for NFT minting |

## Creating a Batch

### Step 1: Access Loan Registry

Navigate to the **Loan Registry** tab to view your onboarded loans.

</Frame>

### Step 2: Select Loans

<Steps>
  <Step title="Filter Loans (Optional)">
    Use filters to narrow down loans:
    - **Asset Class**: Filter by loan type
    - **As Of Date**: Filter by snapshot date
    - **Status**: Filter by workflow status
    - **Batch**: Filter by existing batch or loans without batch
    - **Pool**: Filter by pool or unmapped loans
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Individual Loans">
    - Check the checkbox next to each loan you want to include
    - Selected loans are highlighted
    - Selection count is displayed
    - **Note**: Loans already in a batch or mapped to a pool will have disabled checkboxes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select All (Optional)">
    - Click **Select All** to include all filtered loans
    - Only eligible loans (not in batch/pool) will be selected
    - Useful for bulk operations
    - Can deselect individual loans after selecting all
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Eligibility Rules**: 
  - Only loans with `workflow_status: "STANDARDISED"` can be added to a batch
  - Loans already in a batch **cannot** be added to another batch
  - Loans already mapped to a pool **cannot** be added to a batch
  - The **Add to Batch** button will be **disabled** for ineligible loans
</Warning>

### Step 3: Create Batch

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Create Batch">
    After selecting loans, click the **Create Batch** button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Batch Details">
    Provide batch information:
    - **Batch Name** (optional): Descriptive name for your reference
    - **Originator Name**: Source of the loans
    - **Asset Class**: Type of loans in batch
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Verification Method">
    Select how this batch will be verified:
    - **Self-Certification**: You will certify via ZohoSign
    - **VA Verification**: Submit to Verification Agent
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Creation">
    Click **Create** to generate the batch.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What Happens:**
1. System generates unique Batch ID
2. Loans are assigned to the batch (`batchid` field updated)
3. Loan status changes: `workflow_status: "STANDARDISED"` → `"SUBMITTED"`
4. Batch status set to: `status: "Pending"`, `batchverified: "NO"`
5. Batch appears in Batch Verification tab

- No third-party verification required

**Process:**
1. Select batch with status "Pending"
2. Click **Self-Certify** or **ZohoSign Certify**
3. System generates certification document
4. ZohoSign interface opens for signing
5. Sign document electronically
6. Batch status updates to "Verified"
7. Loans status updates to "VERIFIED"

**Status Updates:**
- Batch: `batchverified: "Yes"`, `verificationSource: "Self Certified (Data Only)"`
- Loans: `workflow_status: "VERIFIED"`, `verificationSource: "Self Certified (Data Only)"`

### Method 2: VA Verification

## Batch Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Logical Grouping" icon="layer-group">
    Group loans by:
    - Same asset class
    - Same origination period
    - Same pool or deal
    - Similar characteristics
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Batch Size" icon="list-ol">
    - Optimal size: 50-200 loans per batch
    - Too small: Inefficient processing
    - Too large: Difficult to manage
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Naming Convention" icon="tag">
    Use descriptive batch names:
    - Include asset class
    - Include date or period
    - Include purpose (e.g., "Q4 Auto Loans")
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Verification Planning" icon="calendar-check">
    - Plan verification method in advance
    - Consider VA availability for VA verification
    - Allow time for VA review process

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cannot Create Batch">
    **Issue**: Create Batch button disabled or loans not selectable
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Ensure loans have `workflow_status: "STANDARDISED"`
    - Check that loans are not already in another batch
    - Verify loans are not already verified
    - Refresh the page and try again
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Batch Status Not Updating">
    **Issue**: Batch status remains "Pending" after verification
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Check verification process completed successfully
    - Verify ZohoSign signing completed
    - Check VA verification was submitted
    - Refresh page to see latest status
    - Contact support if issue persists
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Loans Missing from Batch">
    **Issue**: Expected loans not appearing in batch
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify loans were selected before batch creation
    - Check loan filters applied correctly
    - Review batch details to see included loans
    - Create new batch if loans were missed
  </Tab>

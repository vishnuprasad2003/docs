## What is a Term Sheet?

The **Term Sheet** is your starting point for obtaining a credit facility. It's the document where you outline what you need—how much funding, the interest rate terms, and when the facility should mature. Think of it as your application for the credit facility.

<Info>
**Good to Know:** When your term sheet is approved by the Facility Agent, a Master Commitment is automatically created for you. This moves your request to the next stage.

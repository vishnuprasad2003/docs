## What is a Funding Request?

A **Funding Request** is how you request money from your credit facility. Once you have an ACTIVE Master Commitment, you can submit funding requests whenever you need capital. Each request specifies how much you need and when you need it.

<Info>
**Prerequisite:** You can only create funding requests against Master Commitments that are **ACTIVE**. Make sure a lender has approved your Master Commitment first.

## Creating a Funding Request

<img src="/images/fundingRequest.png" alt="Funding Request Interface" className="rounded-lg shadow-lg" />

### Step 1: Start Your Request

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Your Master Commitment">
    From your dashboard, select your ACTIVE Master Commitment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Funding Request">
    Find and click the **"Create Funding Request"** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Draft Created">
    A new funding request draft is created and ready for you to fill in.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**One at a Time:** You can only have one draft funding request per Master Commitment. Complete or cancel your current request before starting a new one.
</Note>

### Step 2: Fill in Your Request Details

Complete your funding request with the following information:

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|--------------|
| **Draw Amount** | How much money you're requesting |
| **Currency** | Usually USD (pre-selected) |
| **Funding Date** | When you need the funds |
| **Purpose of Funds** | Brief description of how you'll use the money |
| **Notes** | Any additional information for the Facility Agent |

<Tip>
**Auto-Save:** Your changes are saved automatically while in Draft status. You can leave and come back without losing your work.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Upload Supporting Documents

You may need to upload documentation to support your request:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Documents">
    Find the document upload section in your funding request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Collateral Addendum">
    This is the primary document showing your collateral supporting this request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Other Documents">
    Upload any additional supporting documentation as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

| Document Type | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **Collateral Addendum** | Primary collateral documentation for this draw |
| **Financial Statements** | Updated financial information |
| **KYC Documents** | Compliance documentation if required |

### Step 4: Review Your Borrowing Base

The system automatically calculates your **Borrowing Base**—this tells you how much you're eligible to borrow:

| Calculation | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Borrowing Base** | Total amount you're eligible to borrow |
| **Available Capacity** | How much you can currently request |
| **Utilization** | Percentage of your facility currently in use |
| **Collateral Value** | Total value of your collateral |

<Warning>
**Stay Within Limits:** Your draw amount must be within your available capacity. If you request more than available, the Facility Agent may reject or request changes.
</Warning>

### Step 5: Submit for Review

When you're ready:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Everything">
    Double-check all your information, amounts, and documents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit">
    Click **"Submit for Review"** to send to the Facility Agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Your status changes to **"Under Review"** and the Facility Agent is notified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I create a funding request?" icon="question">
    Make sure your Master Commitment is **ACTIVE**. If it's still Draft or Awaiting Lender Approval, you need to wait for a lender to approve it first.
  </Accordion>

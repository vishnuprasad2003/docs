## Credit Facility Workflow Overview

The Intain Markets Credit Facility Platform streamlines the entire credit facility lifecycle through a structured, automated workflow that ensures transparency, security, and efficiency. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the complete process.

## Workflow Stages

The credit facility process consists of four main stages, each building upon the previous one:

### **Stage 1: Term Sheet Creation & Approval**
- Borrower creates term sheet with facility terms
- DocuSign integration for electronic signatures
- Facility agent review and approval
- **Auto-trigger**: Master commitment creation upon approval

### **Stage 2: Master Commitment Configuration**
- Auto-created from approved term sheet
- Facility agent configures lender groups and rules
- Lender approval through DocuSign
- **Auto-trigger**: Status becomes ACTIVE upon lender approval

### **Stage 3: Funding Request Processing**
- Borrower creates funding requests against ACTIVE commitments
- Facility agent review and approval
- **Auto-trigger**: Funding notice generation upon approval

### **Stage 4: Funding Notice & Token Management**
- Auto-generated funding notice with DocuSign
- FT token creation and distribution
- Borrower token transfer approval
- Lender fund transfer confirmations

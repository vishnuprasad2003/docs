## What is Loan Mapping?

**Loan Mapping** is how you connect your loans to your credit facility. When you map loans to your facility, they become part of your collateral pool. This determines how much you can borrow—your **borrowing base** is calculated based on the loans you've mapped.

<Info>
**Why It Matters:** You must map loans to your facility before they can be counted as collateral. Unmapped loans don't contribute to your borrowing capacity.
</Info>

---

## Before You Can Map Loans

Make sure you have:

<Checklist>
  - An **ACTIVE** Master Commitment
  - A Servicer assigned to your facility
  - Loans uploaded and processed in the system
  - NFTs created for your loans (the system does this automatically)
  - Loans not already mapped to another facility
</Checklist>

<Warning>
**NFT Requirement:** Each loan must have an NFT (digital certificate) created before it can be mapped. If your loans don't have NFTs yet, you'll need to create them first.
</Warning>

## What Happens When You Map Loans

When loans are successfully mapped:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Loans Are Linked" icon="link" defaultOpen>
    Each mapped loan is now associated with your credit facility:
    - Loan status changes from "Unmapped" to "Mapped"
    - Facility name is recorded on each loan
    - Loans appear in your facility's collateral pool
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Principal Balance Updates" icon="calculator">
    Your facility's collateral balance is recalculated:
    - System adds up the principal balance of all mapped loans
    - Your Master Commitment's balance is updated
    - This affects your borrowing capacity
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Borrowing Base Recalculates" icon="chart-line">
    Your available borrowing capacity is updated:
    - More collateral = higher borrowing base
    - New available capacity is calculated
    - You can request more funding if capacity increases
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Understanding Borrowing Base

Your borrowing base determines how much you can borrow. Here's how it works:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Collateral Value** | Total value of your mapped loans |
| **Advance Rate** | Percentage you can borrow (from your facility terms) |
| **Borrowing Base** | Collateral Value × Advance Rate |
| **Outstanding Draws** | What you've already borrowed |
| **Available Capacity** | Borrowing Base - Outstanding Draws |

<Note>
**Example Calculation:**

- Total Mapped Loan Value: **$50,000,000**
- Advance Rate: **85%**
- Borrowing Base: **$42,500,000**
- Already Borrowed: **$10,000,000**
- **Available to Borrow: $32,500,000**
</Note>

## Loan Eligibility Requirements

Not all loans can be mapped. The system checks:

| Requirement | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| **NFT Created** | Loan must have a digital certificate on blockchain |
| **Not Already Mapped** | Can't be assigned to another facility |
| **Status: Unmapped** | Must be available for mapping |
| **Meets Collateral Rules** | Must meet your facility's eligibility criteria |

<Warning>
**If Loans Can't Be Mapped:**

If you see an error, check:
- Do the loans have NFTs? Create them if not.
- Are they already mapped elsewhere?
- Do they meet your facility's collateral rules?
</Warning>

---

## Viewing Mapped Loans

After mapping, you can see your loans in several places:

| Where | What You See |
|-------|-------------|
| **Master Commitment Details** | Total collateral balance |
| **Loan List** | All mapped loans with "Mapped" status |
| **Borrowing Base Report** | How loans contribute to capacity |

---

## Best Practices

### Before Mapping

<Checklist>
  - Verify all loans have NFTs created
  - Review loan data for accuracy
  - Check that loans meet collateral eligibility rules
  - Confirm your facility has sufficient capacity for your needs
</Checklist>

### During Mapping

<Checklist>
  - For large portfolios, consider mapping in batches
  - Double-check loan counts before confirming
  - Keep records of which loans you map
</Checklist>

### After Mapping

<Checklist>
  - Verify your borrowing base updated correctly
  - Check that available capacity reflects new collateral
  - Review monthly reporting requirements with your Servicer
</Checklist>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I map my loans?" icon="question">
    Common reasons:
    - **No NFT:** Create NFTs for your loans first
    - **Already Mapped:** Loans may be assigned to another facility
    - **Master Commitment Not Active:** Wait for lender approval
    - **Missing Permissions:** Verify you have Issuer access
    
    Check the specific error message for guidance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What does 'NFT Not Minted' mean?" icon="certificate">
    Each loan needs a digital certificate (NFT) on the blockchain before it can be mapped. This creates a secure, verifiable record.
    
    **Solution:** Go to Loan Management and initiate NFT creation for your loans, then return to map them.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I unmap loans?" icon="unlink">
    Generally, unmapping loans requires administrator assistance. Contact your Facility Agent or support if you need to remove loans from your facility.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why didn't my borrowing base change?" icon="calculator">
    Your borrowing base might not change if:
    - The loans have zero principal balance
    - There's a data issue with the loan values
    - The system is still processing
    
    Wait a few minutes and refresh. If it still doesn't update, contact support.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I map the same loan to multiple facilities?" icon="clone">
    No. Each loan can only be mapped to one facility at a time. This ensures collateral isn't counted twice.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Working with Your Servicer

After loans are mapped, your Servicer handles ongoing operations:

| Servicer Responsibility | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Monthly Loan Tapes** | Upload updated loan performance data |
| **Performance Tracking** | Monitor payments and delinquencies |
| **Borrowing Base Support** | Provide data for capacity calculations |
| **Reporting** | Generate required facility reports |

<Info>
**Servicer Access:** Your Servicer can see and manage loan data for facilities they're assigned to. They'll upload monthly updates that affect your borrowing base calculations.
</Info>

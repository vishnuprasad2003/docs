# Loan Mapping to Credit Facility

Loan mapping allows borrowers to associate specific loans with their credit facilities. This process is essential for collateral management and borrowing base calculations.

## Overview

The loan mapping process includes:

1. **Loan Selection** - Choose loans to map to credit facility
2. **Validation** - Ensure loans meet eligibility requirements
3. **Mapping Process** - Associate loans with credit facility
4. **Borrowing Base Calculation** - Calculate available borrowing capacity
5. **Ongoing Management** - Monitor and update loan mappings

## Prerequisites

Before mapping loans, ensure:

- Master commitment status is **ACTIVE**
- Loans are properly uploaded and processed
- Loan data is complete and validated
- Servicer organization is assigned

## Accessing Loan Mapping

### Step 1: Navigate to Loan Mapping

1. Go to your **Issuer Dashboard**
2. Select an **ACTIVE** master commitment
3. Click **"Map Loans to Facility"**

### Step 2: Select Loans

**Available Options:**
- **Select All** - Map all eligible loans
- **Individual Selection** - Choose specific loans
- **Filter by Criteria** - Use filters to narrow selection

**Selection Criteria:**
- Loans must belong to the same issuer
- Loans must not be already mapped to another facility
- Loans must have "Contract Digitized" = "Yes"

## Loan Selection Process

### Individual Loan Selection

1. **Review Loan List** - Browse available loans
2. **Check Eligibility** - Verify loan meets requirements
3. **Select Loans** - Choose loans to map
4. **Review Selection** - Confirm selected loans
5. **Submit Mapping** - Complete the mapping process

### Bulk Selection

**Select All Option:**
- Automatically selects all eligible loans
- Validates all loans meet requirements
- Processes mapping in batch

**Filtered Selection:**
- Use filters to narrow loan list
- Apply criteria-based selection
- Review filtered results before mapping

## Validation Process

### Loan Eligibility Checks

**Required Validations:**
- **Contract Digitized** - Must be "Yes"
- **Issuer Match** - Must belong to same issuer
- **Not Already Mapped** - Cannot be mapped to another facility
- **Data Completeness** - All required fields populated

### System Validation

**Automatic Checks:**
- Loan ID consistency between PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- Data integrity validation
- Eligibility rule compliance
- Capacity calculations

## Mapping Process

### Submission Details

**Required Information:**
- **Job ID** - Unique identifier for mapping job
- **Selected Loans** - Array of loan IDs
- **Issuer ID** - Borrower identifier
- **Deal ID** - Deal identifier
- **Issuer Org ID** - Organization identifier
- **Deal Name** - Credit facility name

### Processing Steps

1. **Validation** - Validate all selected loans
2. **Update Loans** - Update loan records with facility mapping
3. **Update Previews** - Update loan preview records
4. **Confirmation** - Confirm successful mapping

## Borrowing Base Calculation

### Calculation Process

**Automatic Calculation:**
- System calculates borrowing base based on mapped loans
- Applies collateral eligibility rules
- Determines available borrowing capacity
- Updates facility capacity metrics

### Key Metrics

**Borrowing Base Components:**
- **Total Loan Value** - Sum of mapped loan values
- **Advance Rate** - Percentage from master commitment
- **Eligible Amount** - Calculated borrowing capacity
- **Available Capacity** - Remaining borrowing capacity

## Loan Portfolio Management

### Portfolio Overview

**Dashboard Features:**
- **Total Loans Mapped** - Count of mapped loans
- **Total Value** - Aggregate loan value
- **Borrowing Base** - Available borrowing capacity
- **Utilization** - Current utilization percentage

### Individual Loan Management

**Loan Details:**
- **Loan ID** - Unique loan identifier
- **Loan Value** - Original loan amount
- **Current Balance** - Outstanding balance
- **Status** - Loan status and performance
- **Mapping Date** - When loan was mapped

## Best Practices

### Loan Selection

**Quality Considerations:**
- **Performance History** - Review loan performance
- **Documentation** - Ensure complete documentation
- **Compliance** - Verify regulatory compliance
- **Risk Assessment** - Evaluate loan risk factors

### Portfolio Management

**Ongoing Monitoring:**
- **Regular Reviews** - Monitor loan performance
- **Update Mappings** - Adjust mappings as needed
- **Performance Tracking** - Track key metrics
- **Risk Management** - Manage portfolio risk

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cannot Map Loans:**
- Check master commitment status (must be ACTIVE)
- Verify loan eligibility requirements
- Ensure loans are not already mapped
- Confirm servicer organization assignment

**Mapping Failed:**
- Check loan data completeness
- Verify contract digitization status
- Ensure stable network connection
- Contact support if issue persists

**Borrowing Base Issues:**
- Review collateral eligibility rules
- Check loan value calculations
- Verify advance rate settings
- Consult with facility agent

### Data Consistency

**PostgreSQL vs MongoDB:**
- System checks consistency between databases
- Reports missing loan IDs
- Validates data integrity
- Ensures accurate calculations

## Integration Points

### Servicer Integration

**Servicer Role:**
- **Loan Data Upload** - Upload monthly loan tapes
- **Data Validation** - Ensure data accuracy
- **Performance Reporting** - Provide performance reports
- **Ongoing Management** - Manage loan portfolio

### Facility Agent Integration

**Facility Agent Role:**
- **Rule Configuration** - Set collateral eligibility rules
- **Capacity Management** - Monitor borrowing capacity
- **Performance Review** - Review loan performance
- **Risk Assessment** - Assess portfolio risk

## Reporting and Analytics

### Portfolio Reports

**Available Reports:**
- **Loan Summary** - Overview of mapped loans
- **Performance Metrics** - Key performance indicators
- **Risk Analysis** - Portfolio risk assessment
- **Capacity Utilization** - Borrowing capacity usage

### Real-time Updates

**Live Monitoring:**
- **Status Updates** - Real-time status changes
- **Performance Tracking** - Live performance metrics
- **Capacity Alerts** - Capacity threshold notifications
- **Risk Alerts** - Risk threshold notifications

## Next Steps

After loan mapping:

1. **Monitor Performance** - Track loan performance metrics
2. **Update Mappings** - Adjust mappings as needed
3. **Regular Reviews** - Conduct periodic portfolio reviews
4. **Reporting** - Provide required reporting to stakeholders

## What Happens When You Upload a Document?

When you upload a document to the platform:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload">
    You upload your document through the platform interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processing">
    The system generates a unique identifier (hash) for your document.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Storage">
    Your document is securely stored across multiple servers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    You receive confirmation that your document is safely stored.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**What is a Hash?** Think of it like a digital fingerprint for your document. It's unique to your file and proves the document hasn't been changed.

## What is a Loan Tape?

A loan tape is a monthly data file containing detailed performance information about loans in your portfolio. Servicers upload these files regularly to keep the credit facility data current and accurate.

<Note>
**Monthly Requirement:** Loan tapes should be uploaded by the end of each month to ensure accurate borrowing base calculations and reporting.

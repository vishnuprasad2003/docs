## Exceptions & Operational Notes

This guide covers critical operational notes, exceptions, and best practices for the securitization workflow.

## Critical Operational Rules

### Mandatory Tranche Approvals

<Warning>
**Tranche approvals are mandatory before publishing to Investors.**
</Warning>

**Rule**: All tranches must be individually approved by the Issuer before the deal can be published to investors.

**Process**:
1. Underwriter publishes deal to Issuer (deal status: **Awaiting Approval**)
2. Issuer must approve each tranche individually:
   - Navigate to **Deals** → Securitization Deal
   - Click **Approve Issuance/Tranches**
   - Enter C-Chain private key or upload wallet JSON
   - Approve each tranche one by one
3. System validates all tranches are approved
4. Only after all tranches approved: **Publish to Investors** button becomes active
5. Deal can then be published and becomes **Open**

**Cannot Skip**: It is impossible to publish to investors without tranche approval. System enforces this requirement.

### FT Transfer Timing

<Warning>
**FTs are transferred only after PA "Issue FT" (post verification of all investor off-chain transactions).**
</Warning>

**Rule**: Fractional Tokens (FTs) are never transferred immediately upon investor completion. They are issued only after the Paying Agent verifies all off-chain transactions.

**Complete Flow**:
1. **Investor Commits**: Investor commits amount (no FTs yet)
2. **Investor Wires**: Investor wires funds off-line to bank account (no FTs yet)
3. **Investor Marks Completed**: Status updated to "Investment marked complete" (no FTs yet)
4. **Paying Agent Verifies**: PA verifies receipt in actual bank account
5. **Paying Agent Updates Status**: Updates transaction status to "Completed"
6. **After ALL Verified**: PA verifies ALL investor transactions are Completed
7. **PA Issues FTs**: Click "Issue FT" for each investor
8. **NOW FTs Transfer**: FTs transferred to investor accounts on blockchain

**Timeline**:
- Investors do NOT receive FTs immediately upon wiring funds
- FTs are issued ONLY after PA verification and "Issue FT" action
- This ensures all funds are actually received before token issuance

### Preview Reconsider Workflow

**During Preview stage, loan-level rejections loop through Reconsider and Feedback until resolved.**

**Scenario**: During Preview, Underwriter can reject individual loans with reasons.

**Loop Process**:

**Round 1**:
1. Underwriter reviews pool
2. Underwriter rejects specific loans (with reasons)
3. Issuer receives notification

**Issuer Response Options**:

**Option A - Accept Rejection**:
- Issuer reviews UW rejection reason
- Decides rejection is valid
- Clicks **Accept Rejection**
- Loan removed from pool
- Underwriter notified

**Option B - Reject the Rejection**:
- Issuer reviews UW rejection reason
- Disagrees with rejection
- Clicks **Reject the Rejection**
- Provides feedback/justification
- Loan remains in pool
- Underwriter notified

**Round 2** (if Issuer rejects the rejection):
1. Underwriter reviews Issuer's feedback
2. Underwriter can:
   - **Accept Issuer's feedback**: Withdraw rejection
   - **Provide Additional Feedback**: Reject again with more details
3. Loop continues

**Loop Continuation**:
- Both parties can exchange feedback indefinitely
- Use **Reconsider** feature to manage workflow
- Continue until either:
  - Both parties agree (loan kept or removed)
  - One party prevails through persistence
  - Compromise reached

<Tip>
Use the Reconsider feature strategically. Provide clear, detailed feedback to expedite resolution.
</Tip>

### Commit → Invest Stage Toggle

**Commit → Invest stage flip is controlled by Underwriter in General Settings once commitments suffice.**

**Rule**: The transition from Commit stage to Invest stage is controlled by the Underwriter, not automatic.

**Process**:

**Commit Stage**:
- Investors can commit investment amounts
- Commitments recorded in system
- Underwriter monitors commitment levels
- Status: "Commit" stage

**When Sufficient Commitments**:
- Underwriter reviews total commitments
- Decides whether to proceed to Invest stage
- **Note**: No automatic transition - Underwriter must manually toggle

**Toggle to Invest**:
1. Navigate to **Deal → General Settings** (or **More → General Settings**)
2. Find **Stage Control** section
3. Toggle from **Commit** to **Invest** stage
4. Confirm stage transition
5. System updates deal status to **Invest**
6. All investors notified
7. Wire instructions displayed to investors

**Underwriter Control**:
- Underwriter has full control over timing
- Can wait for more commitments
- Can proceed with current commitments
- Strategic decision point

<Tip>
Underwriter should ensure sufficient commitments before toggling to Invest stage to ensure deal viability.
</Tip>

## Operational Best Practices

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Tranche Approval Timing">
Approve all tranches together in one session to avoid approval gaps. Don't publish partially approved deals.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="FT Issuance Coordination">
Coordinate with Paying Agent to ensure all receipts verified before FT issuance. Issue FTs for all investors together.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Preview Resolution">
Resolve Preview rejections promptly. Extended feedback loops delay deal timing. Provide clear feedback to expedite resolution.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Stage Toggle Timing">
Monitor commitment levels closely. Toggle to Invest stage only when confident in deal success.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Template Completion">
Complete deal templates thoroughly. Incomplete templates delay underwriting and issuance process.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Loan Tape Quality">
Ensure loan tape data is complete and accurate before upload. Poor data quality delays verification and approval.
</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: FTs Not Issued After Investor Completes

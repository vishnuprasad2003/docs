## On-Chain vs Off-Chain Actions

This guide explains which actions occur on the blockchain (on-chain) and which occur off-chain in the securitization process.

## On-Chain Actions (Blockchain)

### Issuer FT Transfer Approval

**What**: Issuer grants authority for Intain account to transfer Fractional Tokens (FTs) on Issuer's behalf

**When**: After Underwriter publishes deal to Issuer for approval

**How**:
1. Navigate to **Deals** → Securitization Deal
2. Click **Approve Issuance/Tranches**
3. For each tranche:
   - Enter C-Chain private key, OR
   - Upload wallet JSON file
4. System creates blockchain transaction
5. Approval recorded on blockchain
6. Reversible? No, approval is final

**Blockchain Impact**:
- Transaction recorded on C-Chain
- Immutable record of approval
- Smart contract execution
- FT transfer capability activated

<Tip>
Issuer's C-Chain address must be configured in Payment Settings before attempting FT approval.
</Tip>

### FT Issuance to Investors

**What**: Fractional Tokens issued to investor accounts after verification

**When**: After Paying Agent verifies all investor off-chain receipts

**How**:
1. Paying Agent verifies all receipts as "Completed"
2. Click **Issue FT** for each investor
3. System creates blockchain transactions
4. FTs transferred to investor C-Chain addresses
5. Each transfer recorded on blockchain
6. Investor receives FTs in their account

**Blockchain Impact**:
- Multiple blockchain transactions created
- One transaction per investor
- FT balances updated on-chain
- Ownership recorded immutably

<Note>
FTs are issued only after all off-chain receipts are verified and marked Complete by Paying Agent.
</Note>

### Ledger Commits (Digital Ledger)

**What**: Loan-level and summary data committed to blockchain ledger

**When**: At specific stages of the workflow

**Types**:

**Servicer Monthly Commit**:
- Servicer processes loan tape
- System calculates servicer summary
- Click **Commit to Digital Ledger**
- Loan-level data stored on-chain
- Summary data recorded immutably

**Paying Agent Aggregate Commit**:
- Paying Agent generates aggregate summary
- Click **Commit to Digital Ledger**
- Consolidated data stored on-chain
- Processed flag set to YES

**Blockchain Impact**:
- Data becomes immutable
- Cannot be modified after commit
- Complete audit trail
- Available for reporting

## Off-Chain Actions

### Investor Funding

**What**: Investors wire funds to designated bank account

**When**: During Invest stage after commitments received

**How**:
1. Investor navigates to deal in Invest stage
2. Views displayed wire instructions
3. Completes wire transfer off-line (external bank)
4. Returns to platform
5. Clicks **Mark Completed**
6. Status updated to "Investment marked complete"

**Why Off-Chain**:
- Bank wire transfers are traditional fiat transactions
- No blockchain involvement in actual fund movement
- Platform tracks confirmation of receipt
- FTs issued separately after verification

<Warning>
Investors must complete off-line wire transfer before marking as Completed. FTs are not yet issued at this stage.
</Warning>

### Paying Agent Receipt Verification

**What**: Paying Agent verifies investor wire receipts in bank account

**When**: After investors mark investments as Completed

**How**:
1. Navigate to **More → Account & Transaction Details**
2. View list of investor transactions
3. Verify each receipt in actual bank account
4. Update status:
   - **Pending** → **Completed** (if funds received)
   - **Pending** → **Rejected** (if not received)
5. Enter verification details
6. Save updates

**Why Off-Chain**:
- Actual verification occurs in traditional bank system
- Platform tracks the verification confirmation
- Blockchain actions occur only after verification complete

### Document Management

**What**: Storage and management of deal documents

**How**:
- Documents stored in IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- IPFS hashes stored on blockchain
- Actual documents are off-chain
- Access via blockchain-recorded hashes

**Blockchain Impact**:
- Document hashes recorded on-chain
- Verifiable integrity via hashes
- Documents themselves stored off-chain in IPFS
- Efficient storage solution

## Combined On-Chain/Off-Chain Workflows

### Investor Participation Flow

**Off-Chain**:
1. Investor commits amount during Commit stage
2. Investor wires funds during Invest stage
3. Investor marks Completed

**On-Chain**:
1. FT issuance after verification
2. Transfer recorded on blockchain
3. Investor ownership established

### Servicer Monthly Processing Flow

**Off-Chain**:
1. Servicer uploads loan tape (Excel)
2. Servicer maps fields
3. Servicer reviews summary

**On-Chain**:
1. Commit to Digital Ledger
2. Data immutably recorded
3. Available for calculations

### Paying Agent Reporting Flow

**Off-Chain**:
1. Review aggregate summaries
2. Run calculations
3. Generate reports

**On-Chain**:
1. Commit aggregate summary to ledger
2. Finalize data for reporting period
3. Lock data immutably

2. Investor wires funds (external)
3. Investor marks Completed
4. Paying Agent verifies receipt

**On-Chain Steps**:
5. Paying Agent issues FTs
6. Blockchain records transfer
7. Investor receives FTs

### Complete Servicer Monthly Cycle

**Off-Chain Steps**:
1. Upload loan tape
2. Map fields
3. Review summary

**On-Chain Steps**:
4. Commit to Digital Ledger
5. Data permanently recorded

## Best Practices

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Understand Action Type">
Know whether an action is on-chain or off-chain to set correct expectations and timelines.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Blockchain Confirmations">
On-chain actions require blockchain confirmations. Wait for confirmations before proceeding.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Off-Chain Verification">
Off-chain actions require manual verification. Complete verification before proceeding to next step.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Hybrid Workflows">
Many workflows combine both types. Follow each step's requirements (on-chain vs off-chain).

## Tranche Management Overview

Tranches are the different securities created from a pool of loans, each with distinct characteristics, risk profiles, and payment priorities.

## Understanding Tranches

### What are Tranches?

Tranches are slices of a securitization deal, each with:
- Different payment priority
- Different risk levels
- Different interest rates
- Different credit ratings

### Tranche Hierarchy

**Senior Tranches**:
- Highest payment priority
- First to receive payments
- Lower risk, lower yield
- Higher credit ratings

**Mezzanine Tranches**:
- Middle priority
- Moderate risk and return
- Moderate credit ratings
- Absorb initial losses

**Equity Tranches**:
- Lowest priority
- Highest risk, highest return
- First to absorb losses
- Lower credit ratings

## Creating Tranches

### Step 1: Design Tranche Structure

Plan your tranche structure:

**Considerations**:
- Total deal amount
- Number of tranches needed
- Investor risk preferences
- Credit enhancement requirements

**Common Structures**:
- A, B, C tranches (3 tranches)
- Senior and subordinated (2 tranches)
- Multiple classes (5+ tranches)

### Step 2: Configure Tranche Parameters

For each tranche, specify:

**Basic Information**:
- Tranche name/letter
- Principal amount
- Interest rate
- Maturity date

**Priority**:
- Payment order
- Loss absorption order
- Subordination level

**Terms**:
- Fixed or floating rate
- Payment frequency
- Payment mechanism

### Step 3: Create Tranches

**Creation Process**:
1. Navigate to deal
2. Select **Tranches** tab
3. Click **Create New Tranche**
4. Enter tranche details
5. Save tranche

<Warning>
Tranche structure is critical for investor appeal. Balance risk and return appropriately.
</Warning>

## Payment Waterfall

### Payment Priority

Payments flow through tranches in priority order:

**Waterfall Structure**:
1. Operating expenses and fees
2. Senior tranche interest
3. Senior tranche principal (if applicable)
4. Mezzanine tranche interest
5. Mezzanine tranche principal
6. Equity tranche (residual)

<Note>
The waterfall ensures senior tranches are paid before subordinate tranches receive anything.
</Note>

## Tranche Performance

### Monitoring Tranches

Track performance metrics:

**Key Metrics**:
- Outstanding balance
- Interest paid to date
- Principal paid
- Current yield
- Delinquency exposure

**Performance Analysis**:
- Compare expected vs actual payments
- Track payment timeliness
- Monitor default risk
- Assess credit enhancement effectiveness

## Tranche Updates

### Modifying Tranches

**Allowed Modifications**:
- Payment schedule adjustments
- Interest rate updates (if floating)
- Tranche status updates

**Restrictions**:
- Cannot change priority after creation
- Cannot modify principal after funding
- Requires approval for material changes

## Credit Enhancement

### Enhancement Methods

**Overcollateralization**:
- Loans exceed tranche value
- Provides buffer for losses
- Protects investors

**Reserve Accounts**:
- Cash reserves for payments
- Cover initial losses
- Maintain payment flow

**Subordination**:
- Junior tranches absorb losses first
- Protects senior tranches
- Risk transfer mechanism

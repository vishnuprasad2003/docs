---

## Complete Securitization Workflow

This guide covers the entire securitization transaction lifecycle from prerequisites through investor reporting, including all roles, screens, and state changes.

## Phase 0 — Prerequisites & Roles (Read Me First)

**Who**: Issuer, Underwriter, Investor, Paying Agent (PA), Servicer, Verification Agent (VA)

**Why**: Ensure identities, accounts, and loans are correctly set up before starting securitization so later stages (commit/invest/issue FT/reporting) run without blockers.

### 0.1 User Accounts & Access

**Confirm each participant has an active Intain Markets account with correct Role assigned**:
- **Issuer**
- **Underwriter**
- **Investor**
- **Paying Agent**
- **Servicer**
- **Verification Agent**

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] Organization membership confirmed
- [ ] Email address verified
- [ ] Two-factor authentication enabled (if enforced)
- [ ] Role visibility verified for deal/pool objects
- [ ] Access to relevant sections confirmed

**Role Visibility Test**:
- Issuer should see: Pools, Loans, Deals sections
- Underwriter should see: Pools (for review), Deals sections
- Investor should see: Opportunities, Portfolio sections
- Paying Agent should see: Deals, Loans, Reporting sections
- Servicer should see: Deals, Loan Tapes sections
- Verification Agent should see: Batch sections

### 0.2 Payment Settings (Profile → Payment Settings)

**Set these BEFORE tranche approvals and investor funding**

**Navigation Path**: User → **User Profile** → **Payment Settings**

**Off-Chain Bank Details** (per role as applicable):

**For Issuer/Investor/Paying Agent**:
- Account Holder Name
- Bank Name
- Branch/Address
- Account Number/IBAN
- SWIFT/IFSC
- Currency

**Best Practice**: Use a clearly labeled **"Securitization – Closing/Receipts"** account for PA to avoid ambiguity.

**On-Chain (C-Chain) Settings**:

**Issuer (Mandatory)**:
- C-Chain Address displayed in profile
- Approval Method for Issuer's FT transfers:
  - **Option 1**: Upload wallet JSON/keystore (encrypted) and enter passphrase at approval time
  - **Option 2**: Paste private key at approval time (recommended only if policy allows)

**Why Required**: This approval allows the platform's Intain C-Chain account to transfer FTs on the Issuer's behalf per-tranche during issuance.

**Paying Agent (Optional)**:
- C-Chain setup required if applicable to your configuration

<Warning>
**Security Tip**: Use a non-trading hot wallet for approvals; keep treasury keys offline. Document the approver's identity and policy in your runbook.
</Warning>

### 0.3 Loan Onboarding & Verification (Pre-Underwriter)

**Objective**: Make loans eligible for underwriting by completing data preparation and third-party verification.

**Complete Process**:

1. **Issuer Uploads Loan Tape** (Excel)
   - Navigate to **Loans** → **Add Loans**
   - Click **Upload Excel**
   - Select and upload Excel file

2. **Map Fields to Intain Standard Schema**
   - Map each column to corresponding Intain standard field
   - Map essentials:
     - Loan ID
     - UPB (Unpaid Principal Balance)
     - Interest Rate
     - Product Type
     - Origination Date
     - Maturity Date
     - Payment amounts
     - Arrears status
     - Collateral/Valuation
     - Geography
     - Borrower attributes (as permitted)
   - Save mapping profile for reuse (one-time mapping reusable across uploads)

3. **(Optional) Filter/Tag Loans**
   - Apply filters for target pool
   - Select loans based on criteria

4. **Create Verification Batch**
   - Select loans for batch
   - Create batch with selected loans

5. **Submit to VA**
   - Click **Submit for Verification**
   - Batch sent to Verification Agent

**VA Workflow** (Verification Agent):
- **Review**: Compare evidence/LMS vs contract data
- **Certify**: VA signs off; issues certificate
- **Verify**: NFT/verified state enabled

**Outcomes**:
- **Verified**: Loans marked verified and eligible for Underwriter submission
- **Self-Verified**: If issuer acts as VA (per program rules)
- **Rejected**: Loans not meeting criteria
- **Reviewed**: Flagged with comments (Issuer can fix and resubmit)

**Result**: Loans marked **Verified** and eligible for Underwriter submission.

### 0.4 Status Model (Quick Reference)

**Pool Statuses**:
```
Created → Submitted → Accepted (→ Deal created) / Rejected → Closed (if abandoned)
```

**Deal Statuses**:
```
Created → Awaiting Approval (Issuer tranche approvals) → Open (published) → Closed
```

**Loan/Batch Statuses (VA)**:
```
Pending → Reviewed → Certified → Verified (eligible)
```

### 0.5 Document Hygiene

**Upload to Pool/Deal Documents Tab**:

**Required Documents**:
- Offering documents drafts
- Data tape
- Stratifying summaries
- Legal opinions drafts
- Servicing agreement
- Paying agent appointment
- Fee schedules

**Documentation Standards**:

2. Issuer receives rejection notification
3. Issuer can:
   - **Accept Rejection**: Remove loan from pool
   - **Reject the Rejection**: Keep loan with feedback
4. Feedback loop continues until resolution

## Phase 1 — Issuer Creates and Readies a Pool

**Pool Creation → Loan Upload → Mapping → Preview → Submission to Underwriter**

### 🎯 Objective

To build a clean, verified, and review-ready loan pool that will later be securitized.

In this stage, the Issuer is responsible for:
- Creating a new pool with key identifiers
- Uploading and mapping the raw loan data (loan tape) into Intain's standardized schema
- Validating and reviewing the data
- Submitting the pool for preview (feedback loop with Underwriter / Rating Agency / Investors)
- Submitting for formal Underwriter review once loans are verified

**Issuer Response Options**:

**Accept the Rejection** (Remove):
1. Review Underwriter rejection reason
2. Evaluate if rejection is valid
3. Click **Accept the Rejection** for that loan
4. Loan removed from pool
5. Underwriter notified of acceptance

**Reject the Rejection** (Retain):
1. Review Underwriter rejection reason
2. Disagree with rejection decision
3. Click **Reject the Rejection** for that loan
4. Provide feedback/justification/evidence
5. Loan remains in pool
6. Underwriter receives your feedback

**Iterate Until Stable**:
- Feedback exchange continues
- Both parties can provide additional reasoning
- Pool composition evolves based on feedback
- Loop continues until preview set stabilizes

**Good Practices**:

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Preview Comment Log">
Keep a Preview Comment Log in Documents (CSV/PDF) for auditability. Track all feedback and resolutions.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Removal Documentation">
When a loan is removed, record removal reason (credit, compliance, data deficiency) in the comment log.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Feedback Quality">
Provide clear, actionable feedback. Specific feedback expedites resolution and reduces iterations.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Timeline Management">
Set deadlines for preview feedback to maintain deal timeline. Don't let preview loop drag on indefinitely.
</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

**Skip Preview Option**:
- Preview is optional - you can skip entirely
- Submit for Underwriter remains available
- Once verifications and docs are satisfied
- Direct submission saves time for simple pools

### 1.4 Submit for Underwriter (Formal Handover)

### 📈 Outputs of Phase 1

<Table>

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Created Pool record | Pool metadata + linked verified loans |
| Mapped, standardized loan data | Ready for analytics and verification certificates |
| Feedback log | Optional comments and rejections from preview reviewers |
| Underwriter submission | Triggers creation of the Deal object in Phase 2 |

</Table>

### 🧠 Why Phase 1 Is Critical

**Establishes Data Integrity**:
- Clean mapping to Intain schema ensures consistency
- Verified loans guarantee data quality
- Standardized format across all stakeholders

**Provides Transparency**:
- Preview feedback surfaces issues early
- Multi-party review before legal structuring
- Clear audit trail of review history

**Forms the Base Dataset**:
- Foundation for tranching analysis
- Enables rating agency evaluation
- Supports investor analytics and decision-making

**Reduces Downstream Friction**:
- No unverifiable loans enter securitization
- No mis-mapped loans in pool
- Clean pool composition reduces underwriting rejections
- Faster deal execution in later phases

## Phase 2 — Underwriter Converts Pool to Deal & Configures Structure

**Pool Acceptance → Deal Creation → Structure Configuration → Publish to Issuer**

### 🎯 Objective

To accept a verified pool, convert it into a Deal, and fully configure the securitization structure:
- Define tranches (FT structure)
- Assign fees, expenses, and accounts
- Set tests, variables, and payment rules
- Upload and publish the deal for Issuer approval

This phase transforms the raw pool of assets into a financially engineered securitization product.

### 🧭 Actors Involved

<Table>

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Underwriter (UW) | Accepts the pool, creates the deal, configures all economic and structural parameters, publishes deal to issuer for FT approval |
| Issuer | Receives published deal later to approve tranches and authorize FT transfer |
| Intain Platform | Enforces deal schema, locks structure after approval, and validates input consistency across tabs |

</Table>

### ⚙️ 1. Accept the Pool → Deal Creation

**Navigation Path**: Underwriter → **Pools** → Issuer-submitted securitization pool

**Purpose**: To formally accept a pool submitted by the Issuer and generate a securitization Deal record.

**Steps**:
1. Underwriter opens **Pools** tab to view all pools submitted by Issuers
2. Locate the pool in status **Submitted for Underwriter**
3. Review pool details:
   - Pool name and ID
   - Asset class
   - Number of loans
   - Summary statistics
   - Loan tape quality
   - Documentation completeness
4. Decision: **Accept** or **Reject**

**Accept Pool**:
1. Click **Accept** button for selected pool
2. Provide acceptance comments (optional)
3. Confirm acceptance
4. **System automatically converts the pool into a Deal**

**System Behavior**:
- Pool status changes to **Accepted by Underwriter**
- **Deal record is created** in Deals module
- Issuer is notified (via in-platform alert)
- **Loans in that pool are locked to that deal**
- Deal status: **Created**

**Reject Pool**:
1. Click **Reject** button
2. Provide rejection reason (recommended)
3. Pool status changes to **Rejected**
4. Returned to Issuer for corrections
5. Issuer receives notification with reasons

### 🧾 2. Open the Deal (Securitization Mode)

**Navigation Path**: Underwriter → **Deals** → **View Deal Details** (Securitization)

**Tabs / Sections Visible**:
- **General**: Deal metadata, name, type, dates, currency
- **Tranches**: Define structure of issued FTs
- **Tools**: Central configuration area (comprehensive setup)
- **Strat / Summary**: Auto-pulled analytics from the pool
- **Documents**: Attach related files (deal model, offering memo, etc.)
- **More**: Access submodules like Accounts, Transactions, and Reports

**This Deal object is now the digital equivalent of the term sheet or offering structure.**

### 🧰 3. Configure the Deal Using "Tools"

The **Tools** menu is the Underwriter's core workspace for building the securitization model.

#### a. General

**Input or confirm high-level metadata**:

**Fields Include**:
- **Deal Name**: Unique deal identifier
- **Type**: Securitization
- **Currency**: Base currency for deal
- **Deal Dates**:
  - Closing Date
  - First Payment Date
  - Maturity Date
- **Status**: Commit or Invest (stage control)
- **Servicer Details**: Servicer assignment
- **Paying Agent Details**: Paying agent assignment

**Purpose**: This tab defines all header-level attributes used across modules.

**Validation**:
- Date logic validation (maturity > first payment > closing)
- Currency consistency checks
- Required field enforcement

#### b. Tranches

**Create and stack tranches (FTs) by priority of payment.**

**Fields Typically Include**:
- **Tranche Name / Class**: A1, A2, B, etc.
- **Amount / Face Value**: Principal amount
- **Coupon / Interest Rate**: Interest rate for tranche
- **Credit Enhancement %**: Overcollateralization level
- **Payment Priority**: 1 = Senior (lower number = higher priority)
- **Type**: Senior/Subordinate/Residual
- **Maturity**: Tranche-specific maturity if different

**The platform supports multiple tranches and calculates total issuance amount.**

**Purpose**: Defines the economic instruments investors will subscribe to.

**Tranche Structure Example**:
- **Class A1**: Senior, Priority 1, $50M, 3.5% coupon
- **Class A2**: Senior, Priority 2, $30M, 4.0% coupon
- **Class B**: Mezzanine, Priority 3, $10M, 6.5% coupon
- **Residual**: Equity, Priority 4, $10M, Residual

#### c. Fees

- **Closing Account**: For closing transactions

**Purpose**: Required for paying agent to reconcile and disburse payments later.

**Configuration**:
- Account name
- Account number
- Bank name
- Purpose (Collection/Distribution/Reserve/etc.)

#### f. Tests

**Define transaction-level tests such as**:

**Test Types**:
- **Overcollateralization (OC) Test**: OC ratio = (Pool Value / Notes Outstanding)

**Example**: "OC Test must remain above 105% or principal diverted to reserve"

#### g. Variables

**Define reusable constants or parameters**:

**Common Variables**:
- Interest rate benchmarks
- Performance thresholds
- Calculation parameters
- Market rates
- Recovery assumptions

**Purpose**: Simplifies rule editing and reuse.

**Benefits**:
- Change once, update everywhere
- Easier maintenance

#### h. Payment Rules

**Define the waterfall logic: how cash flows are allocated each period.**

**Example Logic Sequence**:
1. Pay Servicer Fee
2. Pay Trustee Fee
3. Pay Class A Interest
4. Pay Class A Principal
5. Pay Class B Interest
6. Pay Class B Principal
7. Pay Residual (if any)

**Configuration Elements**:
- Rule order/priority
- Source account (Collection Account)
- Destination (Tranche/Fee recipient)
- Amount (% of available or fixed)
- Conditions (test triggers)

**Purpose**: Rules reference tranches, fees, and accounts to create complete payment structure.

#### i. Files

**Upload Deal Excel model for audit/reference**:

**Actions Available**:
- **Download Template**: Get deal Excel template
- **Upload Completed Excel**: Upload completed deal model
- **View Uploaded File**: Review uploaded deal file
- **Publish to Issuer**: Final action (see below)

**Purpose**: Maintain deal model for audit trail and calculation reference.

### 🏦 4. Configure Off-Chain Accounts (Wire Instructions)

**Navigation Path**: **More** → **Account & Transaction Details**

**Purpose**: To define off-chain (real-world) bank accounts for settlement and closing.

**Add Accounts**:
- **Issuer's Collection Account**
- **Closing Account**
- **Investor Subscription Account**
- **Distribution Account**

**These details will later be used by Investors for fund wires and by Paying Agent for reconciliation.**

**Data Typically Includes**:
- **Account Name**: Holder name
- **Bank Name**: Financial institution
- **Account Number / IBAN**: Account identifier
- **SWIFT / Routing**: Wire routing information
- **Currency**: Account currency
- **Purpose**: Collection / Subscription / Fee / Distribution

**Purpose**: These accounts bridge on-chain records (FTs) and off-chain financial flows.

### 📤 5. Publish Deal to Issuer for FT Approval

**Navigation Path**: **Tools** → **Files** → **Publish Deal to Issuer**

**Purpose**: To hand off the finalized securitization structure to the Issuer for FT issuance authorization.

**Steps**:
1. After completing all **Tools** configurations:
   - Ensure tranches and waterfall are finalized
   - Verify all accounts configured
   - Confirm fees and expenses set
2. From the **Files** tab, click **Publish Deal to Issuer**
3. Review deal configuration summary
4. Confirm publication

**System Behavior**:
- Sends the Deal to Issuer's dashboard (Phase 3 begins there)
- **Locks editing for Underwriter** until Issuer responds
- **Deal status changes to Awaiting Approval**
- Intain system awaits FT approval via Issuer's C-Chain wallet

**What Issuer Must Do** (in Phase 3):
- Grant transfer authority for FTs on Issuer's C-Chain
- Approve each tranche issuance
- Issuer's C-Chain address must be configured in Payment Settings

### 🔒 Validation & Integrity Checks

**Field Validation**:
- Each Tools section enforces required fields
- Example: Tranche total must equal sum of FTs to issue
- Date logic validation (maturity > first payment > closing)
- Numeric validations (amounts, rates, percentages)

**State Control**:
- Once published, UW can't modify deal structure until Issuer returns or approves
- Preserves deal structure integrity during approval process

**Data Integrity**:
- Accounts, tranches, and rules must reference consistent IDs before submission
- Cross-section validation (e.g., tranche amounts match payment rule allocations)

**Security**:
- All FT issuance authority stays with Issuer
- UW cannot mint or transfer without Issuer's explicit wallet approval
- Blockchain-based authorization required

### 📊 Outputs of Phase 2

<Table>

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Deal Record | Created from accepted pool; holds all structuring parameters |
| Tranche Definitions | Hierarchy of FT classes with economics |
| Payment Rules / Fees / Tests | Codified waterfall and performance tests |
| Off-chain Accounts | Bank accounts for subscription and settlement |
| Published Deal to Issuer | Deal now awaits FT approval from Issuer |

</Table>

### 🧠 Why Phase 2 Is Critical

**Converts Static Asset Pool**:
- Transforms loan pool into structured securitization
- Defines financial engineering of the deal
- Creates tradeable securities

**Defines Economic Hierarchy**:
- Tranches establish risk/return profiles
- Fees and expenses model economics
- Tests ensure ongoing credit quality

**Establishes Bridge**:
- Both off-chain and on-chain transaction flows defined
- Bank accounts for wire transfers configured
- Payment waterfall links assets to securities

**Locks Reference Model**:
- Defines tranching, rating, and investor analytics
- Sets framework for FT issuance
- Establishes foundation for ongoing reporting

### 🧩 Phase 2 Flow Summary

```

```

## Phase 3 — Issuer Approves Tranches & Publishes the Deal

**Approve FT Issuance → Grant Intain transfer authority → Publish Deal to Investors**

### 🎯 Objective

After the Underwriter structures and publishes the deal, the Issuer must:
- Review the securitization structure and tranches configured by the Underwriter
- Approve FT (Fungible Token) issuance by granting Intain's C-Chain account authority to transfer tokens on their behalf
- Publish the deal publicly to the Investors, making it visible under Opportunities

**This phase formally authorizes the deal to go live on the platform and on-chain.**

### 🧭 Actors Involved

<Table>

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Issuer | Reviews deal, approves tranches, authorizes C-Chain FT transfer rights, publishes to investors |
| Underwriter | Awaits Issuer's approval; cannot modify deal during this period |
| Intain C-Chain Account | Performs token transfers once authorized |
| Investors | Gain visibility of the deal only after publication |

</Table>

### ⚙️ 1. Receive Published Deal (Awaiting Approval)

**Navigation Path**: Issuer → **Deals** → [Securitization Deal]

**Purpose**: Issuer receives the securitization deal that the Underwriter has published in **Awaiting Approval** state.

**Steps**:
1. Log in as Issuer
2. Go to **Deals** section
3. Locate the published deal (status: **Awaiting Approval**)
4. Click **View Deal Details** to open the full deal configuration

**Available Tabs**:
- **General**: Deal overview and metadata
- **Tranches**: List of all tranches configured by Underwriter
- **Fees, Accounts, Payment Rules**: For transparency and review
- **Documents**: Uploaded deal Excel, term sheet, etc.
- **More**: Additional settings and transactions

**This review ensures Issuer validates all deal terms before approving on-chain issuance.**

### 🧾 2. Approve Issuance (Grant FT Transfer Authority)

**Navigation Path**: Issuer → **Deals** → Securitization Deal → **Approve Issuance/Tranches**

**Purpose**: To authorize Intain's C-Chain account to transfer FTs (fungible tokens) on Issuer's behalf.
Without this step, the system cannot issue or allocate FTs to investors later.

### 🔐 Key Security Concept

**Each Issuer has a C-Chain wallet address** (configured under Payment Settings in Phase 0).

**Intain requires temporary transfer authority** on this wallet to move FTs/NFTs for settlement.

**The Issuer provides this approval by**:
- **Option 1**: Entering C-Chain private key directly in the UI
- **Option 2**: Uploading the wallet JSON file (containing encrypted keypair)

**Once the private key or JSON is validated**, Intain's C-Chain account gains transfer permission (programmatic allowance) only for the specified deal tranches.

<Warning>
**Security Critical**: This approval allows token transfers only for this specific deal, not access to the entire Issuer wallet. Keys are never stored in plaintext.
</Warning>

**Steps to Approve**:
1. Click **Approve Issuance / Approve Tranches** button

2. System prompts with options:
   - Enter C-Chain Private Key, OR
   - Upload wallet.json file

3. For each tranche:
   - Select tranche
   - Enter private key OR upload wallet.json
   - Enter passphrase if using JSON

4. Confirm action → the system digitally signs approval for the Intain C-Chain account

5. The platform confirms successful authorization: **"FT transfer authority granted"** message

**Post-condition**:
- Deal status changes from **Awaiting Approval → Approved by Issuer**
- Intain can now mint and transfer FTs/NFTs once investor funds are verified
- Each tranche approval is recorded on blockchain

**Approval Requirements**:
- Issuer's C-Chain address configured in **User Profile → Payment Settings** (from Phase 0)
- Private key or wallet JSON for signing
- Each tranche requires individual approval
- All tranches must be approved before publishing to investors

### ⚙️ 3. Review & Validate Deal Components (Optional Pre-Publish Check)

Before making the deal public, the Issuer can cross-check:

<Table>

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **Tranches** | Validate tranche names, face values, and rates |
| **Accounts** | Verify off-chain accounts (collection / closing / reserve) |
| **Fees & Expenses** | Ensure all party compensation entries are accurate |
| **Payment Rules** | Confirm payment waterfall logic aligns with offering memorandum |
| **Documents** | Upload final legal documents (Prospectus, Rating Letter, Term Sheet) |

</Table>

**Purpose**: This serves as a "final QA" before public release — ensuring investors see accurate and approved data.

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Tranche amounts sum correctly
- [ ] Interest rates are as expected
- [ ] Payment waterfall logic is sound
- [ ] Fees and expenses are acceptable
- [ ] Accounts are properly configured
- [ ] All legal documents uploaded
- [ ] Deal structure matches offering memorandum

### 📢 4. Publish Deal to Investors

**Navigation Path**: Issuer → **Deals** → [Approved Deal] → **Publish to Investors**

**Purpose**: To make the securitization deal visible and open to all relevant investor accounts in the Opportunities section.

**Steps**:
1. Ensure all tranches are approved
2. Click **Publish to Investors** button
3. Review publication summary
4. Confirm publication
5. System validates all requirements are met

**System Behavior**:
- Deal status changes to **Open** (or **Live**)
- Investors can now view deal details under **Investor → Opportunities**
- Underwriter and Paying Agent also get read-only visibility
- The commit phase (Phase 4) becomes available
- All participants receive publication notification

**What Investors See**:
- Deal details and structure
- Tranche offerings with economics
- Investment opportunities
- Deal documentation
- Payment terms and waterfall
- Expected returns and risks

### 🧩 5. Post-Publish State

<Table>

| Deal State | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Awaiting Approval** | Published by UW, waiting for Issuer's authorization |
| **Approved by Issuer** | Issuer approved tranches; FT authority granted |
| **Open / Live** | Published to investors; visible under Opportunities; ready for commits |

</Table>

**State Transitions**:
- Underwriter publishes → **Awaiting Approval**
- Issuer approves all tranches → **Approved by Issuer**
- Issuer publishes → **Open** (investors can see)
- Deal ready for commit phase

### 🔒 Security and Integrity Controls

**FT Authority Limited Scope**:
- The Intain account can transfer only FTs tied to the specific approved deal
- NOT the entire Issuer wallet
- Scope limited to this deal's tranches only

**Private Key Handling**:
- System prompts for key input or JSON upload securely
- Key is never stored in plaintext
- Session-based authorization
- No permanent key storage on platform

**Immutable Lock**:
- Once published to investors, deal structure is locked
- Tranches, waterfall, fees cannot be modified post-publication
- Prevents post-approval tampering
- Ensures investor protection

**Audit Trail**:
- Approval actions are timestamped
- Actions tied to Issuer identity
- Blockchain records authorization
- Complete audit trail for compliance

### 📊 Outputs of Phase 3

<Table>

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| FT Transfer Authorization | Intain account approved for token movement on behalf of Issuer |
| Issuer-Approved Deal Record | All tranches and structure finalized and frozen |
| Published Deal (Visible to Investors) | Investors can now view and commit |
| Transition Trigger | Enables Underwriter and Investors to begin commit/invest phases |

</Table>

### 🧠 Why Phase 3 Is Critical

**Formalizes Issuer Authorization**:
- On-chain actions cannot proceed without this step
- FTs cannot be legally or technically issued
- Ensures proper authorization before token issuance

**Transitions Deal to Public**:
- Moves from private structuring to public offering
- Makes deal available to market participants
- Opens investment phase

**Protects Investors**:
- Ensures only Issuer-approved structures are visible
- Provides investor confidence in deal legitimacy
- Validates deal structure before investors commit

**Provides Compliance Linkage**:
- Links off-chain deal docs to on-chain asset representation
- Establishes legal basis for token issuance
- Creates audit trail for regulatory compliance

### 🧩 Phase 3 Flow Summary

```
Underwriter publishes Deal → Status: Awaiting Approval
        ↓

```

## Phase 4 — Investor Commit & Invest; Underwriter Toggles Stage

**Investor Engagement → Commit Stage → Invest Stage (Off-Chain Fund Transfers)**

### 🎯 Objective

To allow Investors to review the published deal, commit desired investment amounts, and then, after Underwriter confirmation, invest actual funds.

This phase manages:
- Investor engagement (Commit stage)
- Deal activation (Underwriter toggles Commit → Invest)
- Off-chain investor fund transfers (Invest stage)

<Warning>
**Critical Note**: FTs are NOT yet transferred here. FT issuance happens only after verification by the Paying Agent in Phase 5.
</Warning>

### 🧭 Actors & Responsibilities

<Table>

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Investor** | Reviews deal → commits an amount → transfers funds off-chain once deal moves to Invest stage → marks transaction as completed |
| **Underwriter (UW)** | Monitors commitments → toggles deal stage from Commit to Invest → oversees investor activity |
| **Issuer** | Passive observer; no action during this phase |
| **Paying Agent (PA)** | Will verify the incoming payments in next phase |

</Table>

## Phase 5 — Paying Agent Verifies Receipts & Issues FTs

**Verify Off-chain Receipts → Confirm Transactions → Issue Fungible Tokens → Trigger IA Module Integration**

### 🎯 Objective

To ensure that:
- All investor funds committed in Phase 4 have been received and verified
- Upon successful verification, FT tokens representing investor tranches are issued and distributed to investors' on-chain wallets
- Once issuance is complete, the deal data is shared with the Standard IA module for ongoing reporting and lifecycle management

**This phase closes the primary issuance and transitions the deal into its servicing lifecycle.**

### 🧭 Actors Involved

<Table>

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Paying Agent (PA)** | Verifies investor receipts, marks transactions as completed, issues FTs |
| **Investor** | Sends funds off-chain, waits for confirmation and FT allocation |
| **Underwriter / Issuer** | View-only; monitor status updates |
| **Intain Platform** | Executes FT issuance on-chain (via authorized C-Chain wallet) |

</Table>

### ⚙️ 1. Verify Off-chain Investor Receipts

**Navigation Path**: Paying Agent → **Deals** → [Securitization Deal] → **More** → **Account & Transaction Details**

**Purpose**: To confirm each investor's payment has been received in the designated off-chain subscription account.

**Steps**:

1. **Open the Securitization Deal**:
   - Navigate to **Deals** section
   - Select the active Securitization Deal
   - Click **More** dropdown menu

2. **Access Account & Transaction Details**:

     - Committed amount
     - Tranche information
     - Wire reference code
     - Transaction status
     - Date submitted

3. **For Each Investor Record**:
   
   **Cross-check against bank statements**:
   - Verify wire reference code matches
   - Confirm amount matches committed amount
   - Check account details (routing number, beneficiary)
   - Verify currency matches
   - Confirm receipt date within expected timeframe

4. **Update Transaction Status**:
   
   **If matched (funds received)**:
   - Update Status → **Completed**
   - Enter verification details:
     - Receipt amount (may differ slightly due to bank fees)
     - Receipt date
     - Reference number from bank statement
     - Comments if needed
   - Click **Save** or **Mark as Completed**

   **If unmatched or incorrect**:
   - Mark Status → **Pending** or **Flagged**
   - Document discrepancy
   - Record reason (amount mismatch, missing reference, etc.)
   - Contact investor if needed
   - Wait for correction before completing

5. **Review and Validate All Transactions**:
   - Continue until all investor transactions reviewed
   - Check that no transactions left pending
   - Verify total receipts align with commitments

**System Behavior**:
- **Payment status automatically updates** across modules
- **Completed transactions** are now eligible for FT issuance
- **Underwriter and Issuer** can view verification status
- **Investors** receive confirmation of receipt

**Purpose**: This step ensures a **1:1 verification between off-chain money movement and on-chain token allocation** — the cornerstone of trust and auditability in securitization.

**Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] All investor wires received
- [ ] Amounts match commitments (accounting for fees)
- [ ] Reference codes confirmed
- [ ] All transactions marked as Completed
- [ ] Bank statements reconciled
- [ ] No outstanding discrepancies

### 🧾 2. Review Deal Balances and Investor Summary

**Navigation Path**: Paying Agent → Deal Overview / Accounts Summary

**Purpose**: Before issuing FTs, the PA validates that deal balances are correct and all investor payments are verified.

**Steps**:

1. **Access Deal Summary**:
   - Navigate to Deal Overview
   - Or **Accounts Summary** section
   - Review aggregated information

2. **Perform Balance Checks**:

<Table>

| Validation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Commit = Paid = Issue** | The sum of committed and verified funds matches the FT issuance amount |
| **Tranche Balance** | Each tranche is fully subscribed and verified |
| **Account Reconciliation** | Subscription and closing accounts reflect correct totals |

</Table>

3. **Review Per-Tranche Summary**:
   - Tranche A: Committed vs. Verified vs. Issuance amount
   - Tranche B: Committed vs. Verified vs. Issuance amount
   - Subordinate tranches: Full verification status
   - Residual tranche: If applicable

4. **Verify Totals**:
   - Total investor commitments
   - Total verified receipts
   - Total FT issuance required
   - All must align

5. **Check for Exceptions**:
   - Any unverified payments
   - Amount discrepancies
   - Missing investor confirmations

**Only after all validations pass can FTs be issued.**

**Validation Rules**:
- ✅ Total verified receipts = Total committed amounts
- ✅ All investor payments marked as Completed
- ✅ No outstanding pending verifications
- ✅ Account balances reconciled
- ✅ Tranche-by-tranche verification complete

### 💠 3. Issue FT Tokens (On-Chain Issuance)

**Navigation Path**: Paying Agent → Deal → **Issue FT**

**Purpose**: To mint and distribute Fungible Tokens (FTs) representing tranche-level securities to investors' on-chain wallets.

### 🔧 Mechanics of Issuance

**Steps**:

1. **Initiate FT Issuance**:
   - After all receipts verified and balances checked
   - Click **Issue FT** button in Deal interface
   - System validates prerequisites:
     - All receipts verified
     - Balances reconciled
     - Deal not yet issued

2. **System Initiates On-chain Minting**:
   
   **Uses Issuer's wallet** (previously authorized in Phase 3):
   - FT issuance via authorized C-Chain account
   - Each FT corresponds to a specific:
     - Tranche class (A1, A2, B, etc.)
     - Investor allocation
     - Face value per token
     - Token contract address

3. **Token Distribution**:
   - System mints FTs on C-Chain network
   - Each investor gets FT allocation:
     - **Investor Wallet**: FTs transferred to registered address
     - **Token Amount**: Based on committed amount
     - **Tranche Class**: A, B, or other tranche
     - **Transaction Hash**: On-chain confirmation

4. **Record Transaction Details**:
   - Transaction hash/signature recorded for audit trail
   - Blockchain confirmation received

**What IA Module Receives**:
- Deal metadata (name, dates, type)
- Tranche structures and economics
- Investor allocations and balances
- Payment waterfall rules
- Fee and expense schedules
- Test parameters
- Account details

**System Behavior**:

**Upon FT Issuance Completion**:

1. **Data Sync Triggered**:
   - Deal metadata synced with IA module
   - Tranche details shared
   - Token balances synchronized
   - Investor list transferred

2. **IA Module Configuration**:
   - IA uses this data for:
     - **Interest calculations** (monthly payments)
     - **Payment schedules** (when distributions occur)
     - **Periodic reports** (investor statements)
     - **Cashflow management** (waterfall execution)
     - **Test monitoring** (overcollateralization, etc.)

3. **Lifecycle Transition**:
   - Deal enters active servicing phase
   - Monthly processing workflows enabled
   - Reporting capabilities activated
   - Investor dashboard integration complete

**This integration serves as the bridge between issuance and servicing.**

**What This Enables**:
- ✅ Automated payment calculations

## Phase 6 — Servicer Monthly Processing

**Upload Monthly Loan Tape → Map Fields → Preview → Summarize → Commit to Digital Ledger**

### 🎯 Objective

To ensure timely and accurate loan performance reporting after deal issuance.

Each month (or on each payment date), the Servicer uploads and processes an updated loan tape, maps it to Intain's standard schema, validates and summarizes data, and commits it to the Digital Ledger.

**This step feeds verified asset-level performance into the securitization ecosystem, enabling accurate waterfall and investor payout computations.**

### 🧭 Actors & Responsibilities

<Table>

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Servicer** | Uploads periodic loan tapes, performs data mapping and validation, generates servicer summary, commits results to Digital Ledger |
| **Paying Agent (PA)** | Later uses committed summary data for aggregation and investor reporting |
| **Issuer / Underwriter** | Read-only; monitor portfolio health and delinquency trends |
| **Platform (Intain)** | Standardizes field mapping, automates stratification, and records ledger commits |

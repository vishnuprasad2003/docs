## Whole Loan Flow Overview

The Whole Loan workflow on Intain Markets enables comprehensive loan lifecycle management from initial pool creation through investor ownership and ongoing servicing. This workflow uses **NFTs** (Non-Fungible Tokens) to represent individual whole-loan ownership, distinguishing it from securitization flows that use Fungible Tokens (FTs) for tranche classes.

<Info>
**Key Difference**: Whole-Loan flows use **NFTs** (one per loan) versus Securitization flows which use **FTs** for tranche classes.
</Info>

## Workflow Overview

The whole loan process encompasses phases from pool creation to NFT transfer:

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Payment Settings** must be configured before NFT approval. Issuer/Investor/PA should set up Payment Settings under User Profile before starting the flow.
</Warning>

<Info>
Whole-Loan uses **NFTs** (one per loan) to represent ownership, whereas Securitization uses **FTs** for tranche-based investments. This fundamental difference drives all workflow mechanics.

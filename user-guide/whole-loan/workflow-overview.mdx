## Whole Loan Flow ‚Äî Complete Workflow

This guide explains how a whole-loan transaction moves from pool creation to investor ownership in Intain Markets. It covers all roles (Issuer, Underwriter, Investor, Paying Agent, Servicer, Verification Agent), required screens/actions, and state changes.

<Info>
**Key Difference from Securitization**: Whole-Loan uses **NFTs** (Non-Fungible Tokens) to represent individual whole-loan assets (one NFT per loan), whereas Securitization uses **FTs** (Fungible Tokens) representing tranche classes.
</Info>

## Participants & Responsibilities

<Table>

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Issuer** | Creates pool, uploads/matches loan tape, submits for verification, accepts pool submission, approves NFT transfers, publishes deal |
| **Underwriter** | Reviews Preview pool, accepts pool (converts to Deal), configures Deal (general, files, accounts), collects commitments and moves to invest stage, publishes to Issuer for NFT approval |
| **Verification Agent (VA)** | Verifies/certifies loans pre-underwriting (batch ‚Üí review ‚Üí certify ‚Üí verify) |
| **Investor** | Reviews published deal, commits to buy specific loan(s), wires funds during "Invest" stage, receives NFTs |
| **Paying Agent (PA)** | Verifies off-chain receipts, transfers NFTs to investors, runs Deal Recurring and reporting |
| **Servicer** | Monthly loan tape ingestion, mapping, summarize & commit to ledger; supports ongoing reporting |

</Table>

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
**Payment Settings** must be configured before NFT approval. Issuer/Investor/PA should set up Off-chain bank (and On-chain where applicable) under User Profile ‚Üí Payment Settings.
</Warning>

### User Accounts & Access
Confirm each participant has an active Intain Markets account with correct Role assigned: Issuer, Underwriter, Investor, Paying Agent, Servicer, Verification Agent.

### Payment Settings (Profile ‚Üí Payment Settings)
Set these before NFT approvals and investor funding:
- **Off-chain Bank Details** (per role as applicable): Account Holder Name, Bank Name, Branch/Address, Account Number/IBAN, SWIFT/IFSC, Currency
- **On-chain (C-Chain) Settings** (Issuer mandatory): C-Chain Address shown in profile. Approval Method for Issuer's NFT transfers: either Upload wallet JSON/keystore (encrypted) and enter passphrase at approval time, or Paste private key at approval time (recommended only if policy allows)

### Loan Onboarding & Verification
Issuer uploads Loan Tape (Excel) ‚Üí Map Fields to the Intain standard schema ‚Üí Create Verification Batch with selected loans ‚Üí Submit to VA ‚Üí VA reviews ‚Üí certifies ‚Üí verifies (NFT/verified state available)

### Status Model (Overview)
- **Pool**: Created ‚Üí Submitted ‚Üí Accepted (‚Üí Deal created) / Rejected ‚Üí Closed
- **Deal**: Created ‚Üí Awaiting Approval (Issuer NFT approvals) ‚Üí Open (published) ‚Üí Closed
- **Loan/Batch (VA)**: Pending ‚Üí Reviewed ‚Üí Certified ‚Üí Verified (eligible)

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Issuer Creates and Readies a Loan Pool

**Create Whole Loan Pool ‚Üí Upload & Map Loans ‚Üí Submit for VA Verification**

üéØ **Objective**

To allow the Issuer to:
- Create a new Whole Loan Pool
- Upload and map raw loan tapes
- Verify data quality and completeness
- Optionally share the pool with the Underwriter/Investor/VA for preview or comments

**This phase mirrors the first step of securitization but with a focus on direct whole loan sale preparation rather than tranche-based structuring.**

### üß≠ Actors Involved

<Table>

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Issuer** | Creates pool, uploads and maps loans, submits for verification |
| **Verification Agent (VA)** | Reviews, verifies, and certifies loan data |

## Key Differences vs Securitization Flow

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Token Type">
Whole-loan uses **NFTs** to represent single whole-loan assets (one NFT per loan), whereas securitization uses **FTs** representing tranche classes.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Commit Semantics">
For whole loans, investor commit often equates to buying the entire loan principal (or negotiated portion) rather than subscribing to a tranche class.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Settlement Action">
The Paying Agent executes **NFT transfer** (not FT mint/transfer) once off-chain funds are verified.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="Deal Structure">
No tranche structures for whole-loan deals - direct sale of whole loans versus securitization tranching.
</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

The Whole-Loan flow in Intain Markets provides a complete workflow for:
- ‚úÖ Pool creation and loan onboarding
